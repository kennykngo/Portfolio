	This over here is my recent yelp Redesign project that I liked doing! It's definitely took a great amount of time. The design of each part took me quite a while but all the work paid off in the end. As a Yelp Elite, I do use that application more than the average person so I somehow came to feel the do's and don'ts for the app! And eventually, I came out with my very own redesign of it!

<p>My next little project was from DES 322. I combined 3 different images of 3 different animals from the internet and created this little fella!

<p> I learned a lot about photography despite me having already taken photography before! I feel like this little project was more about me finding myself rather than me attempting to do the assignment!
