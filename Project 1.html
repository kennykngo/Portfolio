	This over here is my recent yelp Redesign project that I liked doing! It's definitely took a great amount of time. The design of each part took me quite a while but all the work paid off in the end. As a Yelp Elite, I do use that application more than the average person so I somehow came to feel the do's and don'ts for the app! And eventually, I came out with my very own redesign of it!
